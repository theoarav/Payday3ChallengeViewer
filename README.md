## ⚠ This project is now abandoned. Some of the features should still work past the updates (until Starbreeze decides to change how their API works), but new challenges won't have a properly translated name.  ⚠
For developers: Feel free to fork this project, we've added a missing license to the repo, so you can do whatever you want with the code afterwards. There was also a translation project going on right before we made this decision, so if you want to have the localization file for the strings inside the code, please open an issue on the repo itself.

For the people that helped translating the project: Thank you and we're sorry we couldn't really introduce your work inside the project. The basics were all there, we just lost interest with the game altogether. In the latter stages we were actually spending more time writing code for this app than actually playing the game, and the development of the app plummeted soon because of this. 

# Payday 3 Challenge Viewer
This application allows you to check your challenge progression from outside the game and have an overall better experience tracking them, compared to the in-game one.

# Features

- Shows all the challenges inside the game and your progression synced to them from the official Starbreeze API
- Features all 14 languages currently supported in the game.
  - English 
  - German (de_DE)
  - Latin American Spanish (es_419)
  - Spanish (es_ES)
  - French (fr_FR)
  - Italian (it_IT)
  - Japanese (ja_JP)
  - Korean (ko_KR)
  - Polish (pl_PL)
  - Portuguese (pt_BR)
  - Russian (ru_RU)
  - Turkish (tr_TR)
  - Simplified Chinese (zh_Hans)
  - Traditional Chinese (zh_Hant)
- You can filter the challenges by *Categories*, *Difficulty*, *Tactics*, *Heist* and *Weapons*
- You can pin challenges to keep track of them easier
- If you use the [PayCheck3](https://modworkshop.net/mod/44270) server emulator, you can export your item stats to use them inside the emulator.


*There are still a few texts that are still in english, regardless what language you pick (The labels before the filters, the selectbox texts, etc), but all the challenges should be in their respective languages. If you find a translation error within them please don't report it to us. All the text are ripped directly from the game, so if theres something wrong it's just as wrong in-game.*
